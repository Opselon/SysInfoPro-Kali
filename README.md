**SysInfoPro** is an enterprise-grade, interactive command-line framework for deep system diagnostics, performance monitoring, security auditing, and data exporting. Designed for SysAdmins, DevOps engineers, and security professionals, it provides a comprehensive overview of your system's hardware, software, network, and security posture in a clean, modern interface.

While built with the power of Kali Linux in mind, it is compatible with most modern Debian, RHEL, and Arch-based Linux distributions.
